# HelloTeam
W4 Scrum Team: Write a NodeJS Arrays "hello team" program

This week you learned about Javascript arrays and functions. Let's try them out, by writing a program with your team. This exercise can be done together while on a web meeting, or asynchronously, throughout the week. Be sure to communicate with your team and decide which one you are going to do.

Create a team HelloTeam GitHub repository - be sure it is public

Invite every team member to be a Collaborator

Have one team member push their NodeJSExample to the repository

Have all the team members clone the repository 

Have everyone open the folder in VS Code

Have one person create a new file called helloteam.js and create an array variable called teamNames, and add their own name to it, and push to GitHub

Have all the other team members clone the latest code

Have another team member add their name to the array and push the code

Have all the other team members pull the latest code, and repeat steps 8 and 9 until all have completed

Have another team member write the code to print in a loop until all names are printed: Hello _________ 

Have them push their code

Have everyone else pull their code

Share the GitHub link to the program on Canvas
